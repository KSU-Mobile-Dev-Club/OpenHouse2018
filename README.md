# OpenHouse2018

This is a Twitter client Android application created for the 2018 Spring Showcase.  The app allows users to create their
own feed of K-State twitter accounts.  No Twitter account is needed to use this app.  The user can also choose which K-State accounts they
would like to follow and save their preferences.
